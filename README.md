# Solactive-Coding-Challange-Assignment

# Please download my files as a whole (zipfile) and then extract the zipfile. I believe that this will allow my codes to work properly on your end. If it does not, please let me know.
# I have attached export.csv file, which was created by my code on my end. You may want to delete export.csv file to verify if my codes work properly (But even if you do not delete it, you can verify whether my codes work or not because export.csv file will be automatically updated and you can check it by looking at the modified date information).
#In your instructions, you mentioned "The selection becomes effective close of business on the first business date of each month". My understanding is that the newly selected top 3 stocks are reflected in the index on every first business date of each month and I wrote codes based on this understanding. However, if my understanding is wrong and the top 3 stocks selection update is reflected the next day, I can modify the code immediately (please let me know).
